    <!--<string name="sample_definition">A means of evaluating another person's character through a series of unannounced, inconspicuous examinations. Developed by Eddie, it serves to define which people are desirable company and which should not be associated with. As a general rule, a test-passer is a good person while a test-failer is a bad person.\r\n\r\nPassing the test results in the joyous proclamation that \"You pass the test!\"\r\n\r\nFailure of a test is announced simply by saying \"You failed the test.\" This phrase is often used to show general disdain for a person's existence.\r\n</string>-->
